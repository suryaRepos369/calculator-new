        Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of
        Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in
        the nearby parish of Santo António.[8][9] He is the fourth and youngest
        child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José
        Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[10] His
        great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the
        island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[11] He has one older brother, Hugo,
        and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[12] His mother
        revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's
        alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused
        to perform the procedure.[13][14] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished
        Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[15] As a child,
        Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was
        the kit man,[10] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged
        12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a
        fee of £1,500.[17] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near
        Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy.[17] By age 14, Ronaldo
        believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with
        his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[18]
        While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after
        throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[18]
        One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that
        could have forced him to give up playing football.[19] Ronaldo underwent
        heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac
        pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[20] He was
        discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed
        training a few days later.[2
